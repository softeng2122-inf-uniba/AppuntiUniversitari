# Degree Notes


This project was born with the intention of sharing university notes relating to university courses in Computer Science, Data Mining and Cyber Security.

I ask all those who want to contribute to clone the project locally and add your notes in an organized way or to link your repositories in this file, I will integrate it.

The goal is to create a single space where you can find all the material possible.

**SPONSOR**
I will active the sponsor for this repo. To cover all the maintenance costs of the GitHub Account and Git LFS that are very usefull and important for the upload of notes and books in the repo. So i am very exited if you want sponsor me to cover this costs. And if you will share the repo to everyone, we can reach the goals as soon as possible. Thanks.

!!WARNING!!

I am using Git LFS to upload the notes more of 50 MB. I alreay exceeded the free quota of the account, so I will active the sponsor for this project to cover the maintenance costs. Actually if you try to clone the repo, you will find a git error, but don't worry, if you want, you can just download the zip file.
